# QuantumBotX

QuantumBotX is a **Windows-first trading bot and backtesting platform** for
MetaTrader 5. The `main` branch is intentionally kept focused on MT5 so users
can install, test, and run the current app without confusion from experimental
cross-platform work.

> 🚧 **Development Status:** Actively maintained but built in spare time.
> New features and fixes land when the developer's schedule allows.
> Contributions, ideas, and bug reports are always welcome.

Use this project for education, research, demo trading, and strategy validation.
Always test on a demo account before considering any live trading.

## Current Scope

- Primary runtime: MetaTrader 5 terminal on Windows.
- Backend: Python and Flask.
- Database: SQLite.
- Frontend: Flask templates, TailwindCSS, and Chart.js.
- Strategy tools: local technical indicator compatibility layer plus pandas.
- Development baseline: Python 3.12 is supported.

Experimental cross-platform work belongs on dedicated development branches, not
on `main`.

## Platform Support

### Supported

- Windows 10/11, 64-bit recommended.
- MetaTrader 5 terminal installed locally.
- Python 3.12 recommended.

### Python Version Status

- Recommended and verified: Python `3.12.x` (tested with `3.12.10`).
- Newer versions such as `3.13` and `3.14` may work, but are currently treated
  as compatibility tests, not primary baseline.

### Experimental

- Linux with Wine may work for MT5, but it is not the primary support target.
- macOS requires a Windows VM, CrossOver, Wine, or a separate Windows machine.

### Not Supported On `main`

- Cloud/VPS without a local MT5 terminal session.
- Native non-MT5 broker execution.
- Cross-platform broker runtimes.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chrisnov-it/quantumbotx.git
   cd quantumbotx
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   py -3.12 -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install and open MetaTrader 5.

   Log in to a demo account first and keep the terminal running while using
   QuantumBotX.

5. Configure `.env`:

   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

   Then fill in:

   ```env
   MT5_LOGIN=your_mt5_login
   MT5_PASSWORD=your_mt5_password
   MT5_SERVER=your_broker_server
   SECRET_KEY=change_me
   DB_NAME=bots.db
   ```

6. Initialize local database schema (first run):

   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```

7. Start the app:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

## Optional MT5 Helper

The project includes an MT5 setup helper:

```bash
python install_mt5_integration.py
```

Use it to check Python compatibility, MetaTrader5 package availability, MT5
terminal installation, and basic environment setup.

For more detail, see `MT5_SETUP_GUIDE.md`.

## Data And Backtesting

QuantumBotX can download historical OHLCV data through MT5 and use it for
strategy testing. Typical workflows:

- Use the web interface on the backtesting page.
- Run `python lab/download_data.py`.
- Upload CSV files through the backtesting UI.

### Broker Preset Backtests (XM/FBS)

You can run a preset batch backtest tuned for broker environments:

```bash
py -3.12 lab/run_preset_backtests.py
```

Optional:

```bash
py -3.12 lab/run_preset_backtests.py --preset xm_demo.json --tail 5000
```

Preset files are stored in:

- `config/presets/xm_demo.json`
- `config/presets/fbs_demo.json`

Results are saved to `logs/preset_backtest_results.json`.

Supported markets depend on the connected MT5 broker. Common examples include:

- Forex pairs such as EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY.
- Gold symbols such as XAUUSD and broker-specific variants.
- Indices such as US30, US100, US500, DE30, UK100, when available.
- Crypto CFD symbols such as BTCUSD or ETHUSD, when available through MT5.

## Strategy Collection (14 Active)

| Difficulty | Strategies |
|------------|------------|
| 🟢 Beginner | MA Crossover, RSI Crossover, Turtle Breakout |
| 🟡 Intermediate | Bollinger Reversion, Bollinger Squeeze, Ichimoku Cloud, Pulse Sync, Index Momentum, QuantumBotX Hybrid, QuantumBotX Crypto |
| 🔴 Advanced | Quantum Velocity, Mercy Edge, Dynamic Breakout, Index Breakout Pro |

Strategy availability and behavior are validated by:

```bash
python testing/validate_all_strategies.py
```

## Testing Policy

Public-safe tests and diagnostics belong in `testing/`.

Local account-specific scripts, broker diagnostics, recovery scripts, logs, and
anything with private account context belong in `testing_private/`, which is
ignored by Git.

## Repository Notes

- `README.md` is the canonical public README.
- `ROADMAP.md` describes the current MT5-focused direction for `main`.
- Internal notes such as `MEMORY.md`, `TASKS.md`, `RETROSPECT.md`, and
  `WALKTHROUGH.md` are ignored and should not be committed publicly.
- The app intentionally keeps local `.env`, database files, logs, and broker
  state files out of Git.

## Troubleshooting

If MT5 connection fails:

- Make sure MetaTrader 5 is open and logged in.
- Confirm the account, password, and server in `.env`.
- Check that the symbol exists in Market Watch.
- Try a demo account first.
- Restart MT5 before restarting QuantumBotX.

If dependency installation fails:

- Use Python 3.12.
- Upgrade pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.
- Re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If you see database errors like `no such table: bots`:

- Run `python init_db.py` once in the project root.
- Make sure you run `python run.py` from the same project folder.

If `git pull` shows many conflicts after a forced remote update:

- Abort merge: `git merge --abort`
- Realign to remote main:
  `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main && git clean -fd`
